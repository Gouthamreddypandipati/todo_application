    As it can be obvious, to-do list is a good way of work planning and its appropriate execution. However, there are a lot of controversies about how this should look correctly. If it refers to its typical view, we can see just a list of some activities that are supposed to be done in the long run. But such a nomenclature is really not effective – a true to-do list should include many important components that have to become its advantages!

As a rule, to-do list should present the following features:

The timing for every planned activity. It is actually not enough to write a certain task and try to execute it for a certain period. It is important to pinpoint at least an approximate time required for the certain work – it definitely helps specialists to know about their coming busyness and calculate the presumed hours in order to meet their schedule.
Division of all the tasks into different categories. There is so-called prioritization when a specialist determines the most and least significant matters, and one to-do list turns into several task groups. There are many different names for such prioritizing groups, all it depends on the individual approach to prioritizing. But sometimes it can be presented as a special prioritizing matrix, for example, the most common Eisenhower’s matrix with its ‘Urgent and Important’, ‘Important, but not Urgent’, ‘Urgent, but not Important’ and ‘Not Urgent and Not Important’. Such divisions provide a more competitive approach to working day planning and prevent the situations when a specialist starts doing something not essential and important and loses the precious working time.
Extend extra time for every task – this is a good practice to prevent stresses. Indeed, many specialists can feel uncomfortable and anxious themselves in case when they lag to complete all the tasks. Such time tracking is like a safety net for specialists, and every additional 15 minutes can save the situation for the to-do list timing.
